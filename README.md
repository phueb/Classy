 What linguistic abstractions (e.g. noun category) are represented in child-directed speech?
</div>


### Introduction

This repository contains research code for representing the lexical distributions in child-directed speech.

Step 1: Build representations
Step 2: Train a classifier to predict labels given representation built in step 1
Step 3: Evaluate and compare classification performance between models and representational schemes

## Content

- A small collection of simple classifiers
- Example scripts that demonstrate how to train a classifier to predict part-of-speech labels 

## Custom Dependencies

* [CategoryEval](https://github.com/phueb/CategoryEval): has probe words for testing
